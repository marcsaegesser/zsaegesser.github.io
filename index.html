<h2>Volleyball</h2>
<p>I play indoor club volleyball and in a men's league for beach volleyball.<big><b><i> Volleyball is life.</i></b></big> I am at the gym almost everyday and it takes up a lot of my spare time to watch game footage. Currently I play the outside position at <a href="http://www.topflightvbc.com/">Top Flight VBC</a>, but I have also played middle at <a href="http://www.greatlakescenter.com/">SPVB</a> and <a href="http://www.napervillevbc.com/">NVC</a> (all clubs in my area). </p>

<h2>Skiing</h2>
<p>I also love to ski.<i><b> Skiing is second life.</b></i> Unfortunatly though, I live in Illinois. The skiing in my state is limited to none. Because of this I only get to go skiing about twice a year. I have been skiing all over the nation and I hope to go to switzerland.</p>

	<h2>Television</h2>
<p>In my house, the television is almost always on. For my family it is background noise and for some reason keeps everything under control. As a returning student of CTD I came here expecting to be able to have the very nice tv's in the lounges turned on, but apparently there has been a rule change. I do not like this rule change.</p>
